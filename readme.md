# About 

This is an URL shortner built using NODE,EXPRESS,MONGODB and frontend using BOOTSTRAP and HTML. You can get a shortned URL for your long url and when someone tries to hit that shortned url, our application will redirect it to the actual location. If you want the actual URL then we have that feature as well.

# How to set it up?

Simple, just clone the website, and then do a 'node app.js' to run the application. You wanna prepare the .env file as follows

```
NODE_ENV = 
PORT = 
MONGO_URI=
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
DB_NAME=

```

Hope You find this application useful.
